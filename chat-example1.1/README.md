Welcome to the Chat App version 1.1!

This is a chat application based on Node.JS language. It makes use of the popular Node.JS packages like Express and Socket.io. Please follow the following easy steps to run it on your system:

	Step 1} Install Node.JS: This is very easily done and can be found on the net anywhere (TODO: add procedure anyway). You have to download the node installer from its official site and just follow what it says.

	Step 2} Download this example from GitHub: Just use "git clone git_clone_url" in your command line and the files will be downloaded automatically.

	Step 3} Change the directory to chat-example1.1. Then execute the command "node server.js" and you are done to use the Web chat application!

	Step 4} Open a browser (liek Chrome etc.) and type in the address "localhost:3000" and start chatting away.

After you have typed in "localhost:3000" in the browser, you will see the following page where you can assign yourself a username for the chat,
